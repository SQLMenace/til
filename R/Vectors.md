A vector is a collection of elements


To populate a vector with the numbers 1 through 5, you can do the following

```R
> x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

> x

[1] 1 2 3 4 5
```


You can also use a shortcut by using the : operator

```R
> y <- 1:5
> y

[1] 1 2 3 4 5
```


```R
> z <- -3:2
> y

[1] -3 -2 -1  0  1  2
```
