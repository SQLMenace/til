If you have source code in Subversion, Mercurial, Team Foundation Server, or another Git repository, you can now quickly and easily move that code to GitHub with the GitHub Importer


Access the GitHub Importer directly from https://import.github.com, or use the import feature to migrate your code when you create a new repository on GitHub.com
