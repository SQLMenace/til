To add an image to a Github readme file, you use the following


```
![alt tag](Link to image)
```

So for example if I put an image named Bridge.JPG in the same location as this readme file, it would look like this

```
![This is a bridge](Bridge.JPG)

```

Let's see if it works, if you see a bridge that means success

![This is a bridge](Bridge.JPG)
